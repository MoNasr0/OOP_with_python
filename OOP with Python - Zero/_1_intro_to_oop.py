# oop is used to organize code and make it readable and reusable

############################# CLASS #############################
# class is construct of all objects
# class instantiate ==> creating new instance(object) of a class
# class **may** contains methods and attributes
############################# when creating new object #############################
# - python look for __init__() function "constructor function"
# - any function like __func__ is called Dander or magic function
# - __init__ must have "self" parameter which point to current instance
# - self para could be named anything

# instance attributes are in constructor function "__init__(self)"
# instance methods can access attributes and methods in same object
# instance method can access the class itself

############################# class method #############################
# - use @classmethod before method def
# - use "cls" to point to the class itself == "self" to point to object itself
# - it doesn't need a creation of objects to be called

############################# static method #############################
# - use @staticmethod before method def
# - take arg or not as you like
# - related to the class not the instance
# - not have to access class or instance â€¦ but related to class

############################# magic method "Dander" #############################
# - any method between underscores ==> __init__; __len__; __str__
# - __init__ => called auto when creating new instance "constructor"
# - __str__  => return human-readable output about the object
# - __class__=> to know which class the object belongs to
# - __len__  => return the length of the container, called when use "len"
